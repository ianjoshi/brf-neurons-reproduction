> *Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2024*

## Overview

The Balanced Resonate-and-Fire (BRF) neuron introduces stable and sparse oscillatory dynamics into spiking neural networks (SNNs), outperforming previous spiking models such as ALIF and standard RF neurons in both performance and efficiency.

## Python Version

This project requires **Python 3.10.4**, which was used in the original experiments.

## Installation

Create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ianjoshi/brf-neurons-reproduction.git
cd brf-neurons-reproduction

# Create virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv brf-venv
source brf-venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
